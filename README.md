# crypto-qr-code-wallets
- Python program using CoinGecko API to retrieve Top 10 cryptocurrencies (by market cap)
- Uses qrcode library to create QR code .png files encoded with a wallet addresses supplied by user

# Note
- Does not currently function properly with cryptocurrencies requiring multiple inputs (BNB, XRP, etc.)

# TODO
- Support for multiple input wallets, MEMO for XRP etc.
- Input validation in menu
- Input validation for addresses to prevent wrong format (ex. 0x addresses for ETH, etc.)
